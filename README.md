🦠 COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA using Pandas
📖 Overview

The COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA project provides a comprehensive exploratory analysis of global COVID-19 clinical trials.
Using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, the notebook examines patterns in trial phases, locations, sponsors, and intervention types — offering insights into how medical research evolved during the pandemic.

The project also includes a pre-trained data analysis model (.pkl file) hosted on Google Drive for quick access.

🎯 Objectives

Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 clinical trials data.

Understand trends across study phases, intervention types, and sponsors.

Visualize the global research response during the pandemic.

Provide a ready-to-load .pkl file for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
